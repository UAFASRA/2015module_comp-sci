    <p id="p1">My name is Tim Mattingly, I'm 12 years old and my height is 5'1.
    I have 4 siblings, two sisters and two brothers, their names are Lilly, julia, Damian, and Dylan.
    I play hockey and baseball which I enjoy, but hockey is my favorite since I've been playing for 9 years(comp).
    Some of my other hobbies are video games, tubing, and KNEE hockey as funny as it sounds.
    I go to north pole middle, but after this school year I'm going to tanana middle school.<p>

    <p id="p2">I'm going to talk about what I did this summer(so far).
    I started my summer taking a plane to minnesota to play for the AK selects.
    By the end of the tournament played our way to the semi-final game and lost.
    From there on I pretty much just stayed at for a month because I had nothing going on,
    But then I left to go see my biological Dad in seatle on june 15, we did a lot of fun activities, but
    it came to end on june 27 when I came back. I had my birthday on july 3rd and ended up getting a ps4.
    I have done a couple hockey camps since then and now I'm here at Asra.<p>
